# Frontend Mentor - Link-sharing app solution

This is a solution to the [Link-sharing app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/linksharing-app-Fbt7yweGsT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create, read, update, delete links and see previews in the mobile mockup
- Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
- Drag and drop links to reorder them
- Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
- Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
- Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
